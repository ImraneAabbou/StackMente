Once you proceed with the deletion, your profile, personal data, and account settings will be permanently removed from our system. However, any content you have contributed, such as posts, comments, and replies, will remain on the platform. These contributions will no longer be associated with your username or profile but will instead be attributed to an anonymous or "unknown" user.</p>

<p>If you decide to delete your account, you will lose access to all your account-related information. This includes your profile picture, preferences, linked accounts, and any other personalized settings. Once the deletion is confirmed, there is no way to recover your account. Even if you later regret the decision, we will not be able to restore your account or any of its previous associations.</p>

<p>That said, deleting your account does not prevent you from creating a new one in the future. If you choose to rejoin the platform, you can sign up again using the same email address and username, provided they are still available. Additionally, you can link your new account with the same third-party providers that were connected to your previous account, allowing for a seamless sign-in experience.</p>

<p>Before proceeding, please ensure that you truly wish to remove your account and all associated data. If you have any concerns or need assistance, feel free to reach out to our support team before finalizing the deletion process.</p>

<p>Are you absolutely sure you want to delete your account? This action is irreversible !</p>'
