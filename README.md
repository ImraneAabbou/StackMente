# Stackmente

Stackmente is a community-driven web platform designed to facilitate the exchange of knowledge and open discussion. Inspired by the best features of platforms like **Stack Overflow** and **Reddit**, Stackmente allows users to ask questions, write articles, comment, vote, and participate in intellectual conversations across a variety of topics.

## üîç Project Overview

This project was created as part of a final-year academic requirement. The goal was to design and build a functional, interactive, and scalable platform that encourages learning, sharing experiences, and collective thinking.

The name **Stackmente** is a combination of:

- **Stack**: symbolizing the accumulation of knowledge and interactions.
- **Mente**: meaning "mind" in Italian, emphasizing the platform‚Äôs focus on thoughtful exchange and collective intelligence.

The visual identity of the project was also carefully designed to reflect seriousness, determination, and its academic context.

## üöÄ How to Access the Platform

Before diving into the technical construction, it's important to view the platform in action. You can access it in two main ways:

### 1. Access via Public URL (Recommended for Quick Testing)

The platform is hosted online via **Hostinger** and is publicly accessible. While a custom domain name is still pending, you can currently access the app using the following link:
